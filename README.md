# lyrics_word_rnn
This repository implements a word level rnn using tensorflow to automatically generate lyrics in Bob Dylan's style.
This code is a modified version of the tensorflow RNN tutorial:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/recurrent/index.html
Lyrics data is scraped from Bob Dylan's official website, details see (https://github.com/chaovite/BobLyricsScrape).
We use GloVe pre-trained embedding (details see: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
