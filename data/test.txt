far away and another soldier 's deep in prayer eos some mother 's child has gone astray , she ca n't find him anywhere eos but i can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise eos whom nature 's beast fears as they come and all i see are dark eyes eos eos they tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes , eos they tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand , i 'm sure it is . eos but i feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized , eos all i feel is heat and flame and all i see are dark eyes . eos eos oh , the french girl , she 's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel eos hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel eos oh , time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies eos a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes   eos
